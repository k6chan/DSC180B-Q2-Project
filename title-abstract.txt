Title:
Reverse Dictionary with Video Game Characters

Abstract:
Natural language processing (NLP) is a rapidly developing field with recent applications including weakly supervised text classification that uses machine learning techniques to label documents with minimal human intervention.

As the opposite of conventional dictionaries of key-value pairs, reverse dictionaries return the key when given a value. Reverse dictionaries can be augmented using NLP models.

Video game franchises can have over a thousand characters, each with distinct characteristics. For returning fans, one may run into a tip-of-the-tongue situation in which they may recall certain facts but be unable to name a character. We provide a reverse dictionary tool for people to query such facts and receive the name of the character they were describing.
